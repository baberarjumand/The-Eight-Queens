 This program solves the classic computer science problem: The Eight Queens.<br>
 You can read more about this problem here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle
 
 You can also declare custom chess board sizes and the number of queens to place for solutions other than the standard chess board size (8x8).

 This is the third project for the Java Code Clinic (by Carlos Rivas) on Lynda.com.
